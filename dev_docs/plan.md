### Goal
Land Copilot CLI as a SkillOpt backend and start optimizing the
user's own `~/.copilot/skills/*` with SkillOpt. The full design
lives at `dev_docs/design/copilot_integration_plan.md`; the
implementable slices are `COPILOT-1..9` in `dev_docs/ideas.md`.

### Acceptance
- [ ] User has confirmed (a) which Copilot model is the default for
      the new backend, (b) Tier-A skill order, (c) whether to ship
      optimizer-side copilot support in slice 1 or defer.
- [ ] `COPILOT-1` (`copilot_cli_exec` target backend) lands with a
      smoke that round-trips `copilot -p "say hello"` through the
      harness.
- [ ] `COPILOT-3` (`stop_slop` env) trains end-to-end on the new
      backend and produces a `best_skill.md` that beats the initial
      skill on `valid_unseen`.

### Phase 0 — Design review (active now)
- [x] Sweep `~/.copilot/skills/` and classify each skill A/B/C/D
      against SkillOpt requirements.
- [x] Write `dev_docs/design/copilot_integration_plan.md`.
- [x] Seed `dev_docs/ideas.md` with `COPILOT-1..9`.
- [ ] User reads the plan, answers `dev_docs/design/copilot_integration_plan.md § C.3 Open questions`, and picks the slice order.

### Phase 1 — Backend (`COPILOT-1`)
_Pending Phase 0 sign-off._

### Phase 2 — First env (`COPILOT-3` stop_slop)
_Pending Phase 1._

### Phase 3+ — Second env onward
_Per user direction at end of Phase 2._

## Backlog (high level)

See `dev_docs/ideas.md` for the open backlog with stable IDs. The
plan file references those IDs once they become active work.

## How to use this file

1. When the user assigns a task, write a short "Goal" + "Acceptance"
   block at the top of the **Active** section.
2. Break into phases. Each phase is a checkbox list with files
   touched, commands to run, and a verification step.
3. As phases complete, check them off. Keep notes in the same phase
   block (timing surprises, scope changes, things deferred).
4. When the task is fully done, move the whole block into
   `dev_docs/changelog.md` under today's date and clear it from here.
